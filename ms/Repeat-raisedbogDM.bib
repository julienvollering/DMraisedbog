  abstract = {Predicting contemporary and future species distributions is relevant for science and decision making, yet the development of high-resolution spatial predictions for numerous taxonomic groups and regions is limited by the scalability of available modelling tools. Uniting species distribution modelling (SDM) techniques into one high-performance computing (HPC) pipeline, we developed N-SDM, an SDM platform aimed at delivering reproducible outputs for standard biodiversity assessments. N-SDM was built around a spatially-nested framework, intended at facilitating the combined use of species occurrence data retrieved from multiple sources and at various spatial scales. N-SDM allows combining two models fitted with species and covariate data retrieved from global to regional scales, which is useful for addressing the issue of spatial niche truncation. The set of state-of-the-art SDM features embodied in N-SDM includes a newly devised covariate selection procedure, five modelling algorithms, an algorithm-specific hyperparameter grid search, and the ensemble of small-models approach. N-SDM is designed to be run on HPC environments, allowing the parallel processing of thousands of species at the same time. All the information required for installing and running N-SDM is openly available on the GitHub repository https://github.com/N-SDM/N-SDM.},

  abstract = {The development and distribution of Northern mires, including minerotrophic fens and ombrotrophic raised bogs, frequently are presumed to be strongly controlled by the interplay of regional climate and site geomorphology and history. Investigations of these relationships provide insights into long—term trends in ecosystem development by linking geological and landscape—scale processes. In this study, a theoretical model for raised—bog development integrates internal bog hydrodynamics with external factors, including local substrate characteristics, and regional temperature and moisture conditions. The model is used to interpret the development of raised bogs in the Bergslagen region, which coincides with the modern northern distributional limit of those mires in central Sweden. The development of minerotrophic fens that precede bog formation is also considered. Basal radiocarbon dates along surveyed transects are used to assess the pattern and timing of peatland formation and rates of lateral expansion. Previous palynological and lake—level studies from the same region provide independent evidence for changes in Holocene climate. Fen initiation in the region occurred throughout the Holocene under a broad range of environmental conditions. Once established, fens appear to expand faster during moister periods. Locally, substrate slope is an important mediator of fen development, with slopes {$>$}0.5\% inhibiting lateral expansion. Accumulation of Sphagnum peat, an indicator of raised—bog initiation, occurred from ≈ 4000 to 5000 yr BP during relatively dry phases. Rates of lateral expansion were not significantly affected by increasing moisture or by decreasing temperatures until at least 2000 yr BP. However, modern geographic trends in cross—sectional shape of mires suggest that, at the northern limit of their range today, raised bogs are limited by low temperatures.},

  abstract = {Northern peatlands have been a persistent net sink of atmospheric carbon (C) due to the greater rates of gross primary production (GPP) compared to ecosystem respiration (ER). Global warming has raised concerns about the C sink strength of northern environments. In the vast peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) region of Canada, warming-induced changes in sea ice dynamics over the Bay have altered its advective influence on the adjacent lowlands. Despite our knowledge of the short-term C exchange in these peatlands, there remain uncertainties in the long-term combined response of GPP and ER to climate change. In this study, the satellite-data-driven Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model was employed to investigate the response of peatland GPP, ER, and net ecosystem exchange to temperature and moisture changes. The results show contrasting net CO2 exchange at the two peatland sites over the last 20 years, with the fen acting as a net C source (+24 g C m−2) to the atmosphere and the bog serving as a net C sink (−130 g C m−2). There is ample evidence that a warmer and wetter climate enhanced GPP more than ER, while cooler temperatures weakened the peatland net C sink, regardless of the moisture conditions. Additionally, the advective influence of Hudson Bay on the lowlands produced markedly different C dynamics between offshore and onshore winds, with higher respiration rates (12\%–26\%) during offshore winds. We discuss the implications for peatland C balance under more frequent onshore winds in the region.},

  abstract = {A multitude of physical and biological processes on which ecosystems and human societies depend are governed by the climate, and understanding how these processes are altered by climate change is central to mitigation efforts. We developed a set of climate-related variables at as yet unprecedented spatiotemporal detail as a basis for environmental and ecological analyses. We downscaled time series of near-surface relative humidity (hurs) and cloud area fraction (clt) under the consideration of orography and wind as well as near-surface wind speed (sfcWind) using the delta-change method. Combining these grids with mechanistically downscaled information on temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, we then calculated vapor pressure deficit (vpd), surface downwelling shortwave radiation (rsds), potential evapotranspiration (pet), the climate moisture index (cmi), and site water balance (swb) at a monthly temporal and 30 arcsec spatial resolution globally from 1980 until 2018 (time-series variables). At the same spatial resolution, we further estimated climatological normals of frost change frequency (fcf), snow cover days (scd), potential net primary productivity (npp), growing degree days (gdd), and growing season characteristics for the periods 1981–2010, 2011–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100, considering three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP370, SSP585) and five Earth system models (projected variables). Time-series variables showed high accuracy when validated against observations from meteorological stations and when compared to alternative products. Projected variables were also highly correlated with observations, although some variables showed notable biases, e.g., snow cover days. Together, the CHELSA-BIOCLIM+ dataset presented here (https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.332, Brun et al., 2022) allows improvement to our understanding of patterns and processes that are governed by climate, including the impact of recent and future climate changes on the world's ecosystems and the associated services on societies.},

  abstract = {Aim The EUNIS Habitat Classification is a widely used reference framework for European habitat types (habitats), but it lacks formal definitions of individual habitats that would enable their unequivocal identification. Our goal was to develop a tool for assigning vegetation-plot records to the habitats of the EUNIS system, use it to classify a European vegetation-plot database, and compile statistically-derived characteristic species combinations and distribution maps for these habitats. Location Europe. Methods We developed the classification expert system EUNIS-ESy, which contains definitions of individual EUNIS habitats based on their species composition and geographic location. Each habitat was formally defined as a formula in a computer language combining algebraic and set-theoretic concepts with formal logical operators. We applied this expert system to classify 1,261,373 vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA) and other databases. Then we determined diagnostic, constant and dominant species for each habitat by calculating species-to-habitat fidelity and constancy (occurrence frequency) in the classified data set. Finally, we mapped the plot locations for each habitat. Results Formal definitions were developed for 199 habitats at Level 3 of the EUNIS hierarchy, including 25 coastal, 18 wetland, 55 grassland, 43 shrubland, 46 forest and 12 man-made habitats. The expert system classified 1,125,121 vegetation plots to these habitat groups and 73,188 to other habitats, while 63,064 plots remained unclassified or were classified to more than one habitat. Data on each habitat were summarized in factsheets containing habitat description, distribution map, corresponding syntaxa and characteristic species combination. Conclusions EUNIS habitats were characterized for the first time in terms of their species composition and distribution, based on a classification of a European database of vegetation plots using the newly developed electronic expert system EUNIS-ESy. The data provided and the expert system have considerable potential for future use in European nature conservation planning, monitoring and assessment.},

  abstract = {This article describes FloraVeg.EU, a new online database with open-access information on European vegetation units (phytosociological syntaxa), vegetated habitats, and plant taxa. It consists of three modules. (1) The Vegetation module includes 149 phytosociological classes, 378 orders and 1305 alliances of an updated version of the EuroVegChecklist modified based on the decisions of the European Vegetation Classification Committee. Vegetation units dominated by vascular plants are characterized by country-based distribution maps and data on the dominant life forms, phenology, soil properties, relationships to vegetation regions, elevational vegetation belts and azonal habitats, successional status, and degree of naturalness. A list of diagnostic taxa is also provided for each class. (2) The Habitats module includes vascular-plant-dominated terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitat types from the first to the third or fourth highest hierarchical levels of the EUNIS classification. Of these, 249 vegetated habitats are characterized by a brief description, a point-based distribution map, diagnostic, constant, and dominant taxa, and a list of the corresponding alliances. (3) The Species module provides information on 37 characteristics of European vascular plant species and some infrageneric or infraspecific taxa, including functional traits (habitus and growth type, leaf, flower, fruit and seed traits, and trophic mode), taxon origin (native vs alien), and ecological information (environmental relationships, Ellenberg-type indicator values, disturbance indicator values, and relationships to vegetation units and habitat types). Values for at least three variables are available for 36,404 species. Individual taxa, vegetation units, and habitats in these three modules are illustrated by more than 34,000 photographs. The Download section of FloraVeg.EU provides open-access data sets in a spreadsheet format that can be used for analyses. FloraVeg.EU is a new resource with easily accessible data that can be used for research in vegetation science, ecology, and biogeography, as well as for education and conservation applications.},

  abstract = {We assessed the vulnerability of blanket peat to climate change in Great Britain using an ensemble of 8 bioclimatic envelope models. We used 4 published models that ranged from simple threshold models, based on total annual precipitation, to Generalised Linear Models (GLMs, based on mean annual temperature). In addition, 4 new models were developed which included measures of water deficit as threshold, classification tree, GLM and generalised additive models (GAM). Models that included measures of both hydrological conditions and maximum temperature provided a better fit to the mapped peat area than models based on hydrological variables alone. Under UKCIP02 projections for high (A1F1) and low (B1) greenhouse gas emission scenarios, 7 out of the 8 models showed a decline in the bioclimatic space associated with blanket peat. Eastern regions (Northumbria, North York Moors, Orkney) were shown to be more vulnerable than higher-altitude, western areas (Highlands, Western Isles and Argyle, Bute and The Trossachs). These results suggest a long-term decline in the distribution of actively growing blanket peat, especially under the high emissions scenario, although it is emphasised that existing peatlands may well persist for decades under a changing climate. Observational data from long-term monitoring and manipulation experiments in combination with process-based models are required to explore the nature and magnitude of climate change impacts on these vulnerable areas more fully.},

In Europe, this is common only in Scotland and Ireland, coincident with the oceanic climate, and constitutes a significant global component of this ecosystem. Associated with this Atlantic distribution, Ireland has 50\% of the remaining blanket bogs of conservation importance within the Atlantic Biogeographic Region of Europe. It is anticipated that future climate change will place additional pressure on these systems. Active blanket bog distributions in Ireland were modelled using 7 bioclimatic envelope modelling techniques implemented in the BIOMOD modelling framework. The 1961 to 1990 baseline models achieved a very good agreement with the observed distribution, and suggest a strong dependency on climate. The discrimination ability of the fitted models was assessed using the area under the curve (range 0.915 to 0.976) of a receiver operating characteristic plot. An ensemble prediction from all the models was computed in BIOMOD and used to project changes based on outputs from a dynamically downscaled climate change scenario for 2031 to 2060. The consistent predictions between the individual models for the baseline change substantially for the climate change projections, with losses of \textasciitilde -82\% to gains of \textasciitilde +15\% projected depending on the individual model type. However, small gains in climate space in the Midlands, east and northeast of the country projected by the consensus model are unlikely to be realised as it will not be possible for new habitat to form.},

While traditionally used to model imperfect detection using structured data from systematic surveys of wildlife, occupancy models provide a framework for modelling the imperfect collection process that results in digital specimen data. In this study, we explore methods for adapting occupancy models for use with biased opportunistic occurrence data from museum specimens and citizen science platforms using seven species of Anacardiaceae in Florida as a case study. We explored two methods of incorporating information about collection effort to inform our uncertainty around species presence: 1) filtering the data to exclude collectors unlikely to collect the focal species and 2) incorporating collection covariates (collection type, time of collection and history of previous detections) into a model of collection probability. We found that the best models incorporated both the background data filtration step as well as collector covariates. Month, method of collection and whether a collector had previously collected the focal species were important predictors of collection probability. Efforts to standardize meta-data associated with data collection will improve efforts for modeling the spatial distribution of a variety of species.},

  abstract = {Wetlands in general and mires in particular belong to the most important terrestrial carbon stocks globally. Mires (i.e. bogs, transition bogs and fens) are assumed to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they depend on specific, namely cool and humid, climatic conditions. In this paper, we use distribution data of the nine mire types to be found in Austria and habitat distribution models for four IPCC scenarios to evaluate climate change induced risks for mire ecosystems within the 21st century. We found that climatic factors substantially contribute to explain the current distribution of all nine Austrian mire ecosystem types. Summer temperature proved to be the most important predictor for the majority of mire ecosystems. Precipitation—mostly spring and summer precipitation sums—was influential for some mire ecosystem types which depend partly or entirely on ground water supply (e.g. fens). We found severe climate change induced risks for all mire ecosystems, with rain-fed bog ecosystems being most threatened. Differences between scenarios are moderate for the mid-21st century, but become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century, with near total loss of climate space projected for some ecosystem types (bogs, quagmires) under severe climate change. Our results imply that even under minimum expected, i.e. inevitable climate change, climatic risks for mires in Austria will be considerable. Nevertheless, the pronounced differences in projected habitat loss between moderate and severe climate change scenarios indicate that limiting future warming will likely contribute to enhance long-term survival of mire ecosystems, and to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing peat. Effectively stopping and reversing the deterioration of mire ecosystems caused by conventional threats can be regarded as a contribution to climate change mitigation. Because hydrologically intact mires are more resilient to climatic changes, this would also maintain the nature conservation value of mires, and help to reduce the severe climatic risks to which most Austrian mire ecosystems may be exposed in the 2nd half of the 21st century according to IPCC scenarios.},

  abstract = {Aim A model was developed that estimates the climatic and geographical distribution of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in western Canada and North America. Location The model is based on the abundance of Sphagnum species on 640 peatland sites located in proximity to permanent weather stations throughout western Canada. Methods The per cent cover of Sphagnum species was quantified for all possible combinations of mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual total precipitation (MATP) found in western Canada. Abundance values were expanded to include all climatic values in North America, by interpolating within the matrix of values for western Canada using distance-weighted means. Because Sphagnum-dominated peatlands do not occur in areas having summer moisture index (P–PET) values ≤ 6 cm, that value was also included in the model. The result produced a matrix of 3360 grid nodes in which each node was characterized by MAT, MATP and P–PET values and the presence of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The climatic data in the model was then match merged with the MAT, MATP and P–PET values obtained from Leemans \& Cramer (The IIASA Database for Mean Monthly Values of Temperature, Precipitation, and Cloudiness on a Global Terrestrial Grid. International Institute for Systems Analysis, Laxenberg, 1991), which is a global data set that also contains geographical data on a 0.5° latitude by longitude grid. The geographical distribution of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands was then mapped for western Canada and North America. Those maps were compared with the observed distribution of bogs and poor fens for the same area. Results Results of the comparisons indicated that the model's estimations matched the southern distribution of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands relatively closely. Results for the northern distribution, however, were not as accurate. The overall accuracy was c. 80\%. Main conclusions Some of the errors were caused by inaccurate climatic data which resulted from the lack of permanent weather stations in northern areas and the lack of definition of the northern limits of the actual distribution of bogs and poor fens. In areas where both the climatic data and the actual distribution of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands are accurate, the model accuracy was c. 90\%.},

  abstract = {Spatial truncation in species distribution models (SDMs) might cause niche truncation and model transferability issues, particularly when extrapolating models to non-analog environmental conditions. While broad calibration extents reduce truncation issues, they usually overlook local ecological factors driving species distributions at finer resolution. Spatially-nested hierarchical SDMs (HSDMs) address truncation by merging (a) a global model calibrated with broadly extended, yet typically low-resolution, basic, and imprecise data; and (b) a regional model calibrated with spatially restricted but more precise and reliable data. This study aimed to examine HSDMs' efficacy to overcome spatial truncation in national-scale studies. We compared two hierarchical strategies (‘covariate', which uses the global model output as a covariate for the regional model, and ‘multiply', which calculates the geometric mean of the global and regional models) and a non-hierarchical strategy. The three strategies were compared in terms of niche truncation, environmental extrapolation, model performance, species' predicted distributions and shifts, and trends in species richness. We examined the consistency of the results over two study areas (Spain and Switzerland), 108 tree species, and four future climate scenarios. Only the non-hierarchical strategy was susceptible to niche truncation, and environmental extrapolation issues. Hierarchical strategies, particularly the ‘covariate' one, presented greater model accuracy than non-hierarchical strategies. The non-hierarchical strategy predicted the highest overall values and the lowest decreases over time in species distribution ranges and richness. Differences between strategies were more evident in Switzerland, which was more affected by niche truncation issues. Spain was more negatively affected by climate change and environmental extrapolation. The ‘covariate' strategy exhibited higher model performance than the ‘multiply' one. However, uncertainties regarding model temporal transferability advocate for adopting and further examining multiple hierarchical approaches. This research underscores the importance of adopting spatially-nested hierarchical SDMs given the compromised reliability of non-hierarchical approaches due to niche truncation and extrapolation issues.},

Comparison of old (1940–1970s) and new aerial images revealed decrease of flarks (wet hollows) in patterned fens by 33–63\% in middle boreal and 16–42\% in northern boreal sites, as lawns of bog               Sphagnum               mosses expanded over fens. Peat core transects across transformed areas were used to verify the remote sensing inference with stratigraphic analyses of macrofossils, hyperspectral imaging, and age-depth profiles derived from               14               C AMS dating and pine pollen density. The transect data revealed that the changes observed by remote sensing during past decades originated already from the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) between 1700–1850 CE in bog zones and later in the flarks of fen zones. The average lateral expansion rate of bogs over fen zones was 0.77~m y               −1               (range 0.19–1.66) as estimated by remote sensing, and 0.71~m y               −1               (range 0.13–1.76) based on peat transects. The contemporary plant communities conformed to the macrofossil communities, and distinct vegetation zones were recognized as representing recently changed areas. The fen-bog transition increased the apparent carbon accumulation, but it can potentially threaten fen species and habitats. These observations indicate that rapid lateral bog expansion over aapa mires may be in progress, but more research is needed to reveal if ongoing fen-bog transitions are a commonplace phenomenon in northern mires.},

  abstract = {Peatlands store approximately 30\% of global soil carbon, most in moss-dominated bogs. Future climatic changes, such as changes in precipitation patterns and warming, are expected to affect peat bog vegetation composition and thereby its long-term carbon sequestration capacity. Theoretical work suggests that an episode of rapid environmental change is more likely to trigger transitions to alternative ecosystem states than a gradual, but equally large, change in conditions. We used a dynamic vegetation model to explore the impacts of drought events and increased temperature on vegetation composition of temperate peat bogs. We analyzed the consequences of six patterns of summer drought events combined with five temperature scenarios to test whether an open peat bog dominated by moss (Sphagnum) could shift to a tree-dominated state. Unexpectedly, neither a gradual decrease in the amount of summer precipitation nor the occurrence of a number of extremely dry summers in a row could shift the moss-dominated peat bog permanently into a tree-dominated peat bog. The increase in tree biomass during drought events was unable to trigger positive feedbacks that keep the ecosystem in a tree-dominated state after a return to previous ‘normal’ rainfall conditions. In contrast, temperature increases from 1 °C onward already shifted peat bogs into tree-dominated ecosystems. In our simulations, drought events facilitated tree establishment, but temperature determined how much tree biomass could develop. Our results suggest that under current climatic conditions, peat bog vegetation is rather resilient to drought events, but very sensitive to temperature increases, indicating that future warming is likely to trigger persistent vegetation shifts.},

  abstract = {Aapa mires are EU priority habitats that harbour unique biodiversity values but face increasing global change threats. Here, we investigate the exposure of red-listed aapa mire species inhabiting fen and flark fen habitats to the impacts of land use and climate change. Climate change-based threats were assessed across the aapa mire zone of Finland based on climate velocities (a metric describing the speed and direction of climate movement) measured for mean January temperature (TJan), growing degree days (GDD5) and mean annual water balance (WAB). Land use threats were assessed based on the cover of drainage ditches and three other adverse land use types around the species occurrences. Our results suggest that rapid changes in TJan may alter winter thermal conditions and thereby also species performance, particularly in the northernmost part of the aapa mire zone, where the most valuable concentrations of red-listed species are situated. The land use and GDD5 threats are highest in the southern regions where the red-listed aapa mire species occurrences are sparser but face severe risks to their persistence. In the central part of the aapa mire zone, a number of valuable aapa mires with red-listed species are exposed to both intermediately high TJan and GDD5 velocities and a spatially varying amount of ditching. Three conservation approaches to support the persistence of red-listed aapa mire species: (i) restoration, (ii) establishment of new protected areas, and (iii) monitoring of the key habitats, should be flexibly and complementarily applied to the preservation of aapa mires subject to accelerating climate change.},

Heikkinen1, Kaisu Aapala1, Niko Leikola1 and Juha Aalto2: Exposure of boreal aapa mires to climate change, in review. 1 Biodiversity Centre, Finnish Environment Institute, Latokartanonkaari 11, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland 2 Finnish Meteorological Institute, Weather and climate change impact research, Helsinki, Finland The data files are embedded in four compressed zip files (one of them including a geodatabase folder with files) which include several ArcGIS compatible tiff-raster or shape files. The names and contents of the four zipped files are as follows: (1) mires.zip – includes shape files describing the location and spatial configuration of the aapa mires (‘Aapa\_mires.shp’) and the wet aapa mires (‘Wet\_aapa\_mires.shp’) included in the study, and the borders of different mire zones in Finland (‘Mire\_zones.shp’); (2) climate\_data\_aapa\_mires.zip – includes 18 tiff raster files showing the values of the six bioclimatic variables in the studied aapa mires within the 50 x 50 m resolution grid.

The coordinate system for the data files is: ETRS-TM35FIN (EPSG: 3067) (or YKJ Finland/Finnish Uniform Coordinate System (EPSG: 2393)). Summarization of the key settings of the study is provided below. A detailed treatment is included in the manuscript Heikkinen et al. (in review). Once the manuscript is accepted for publication an updated link will be provided. Study system: Aapa mires are waterlogged, peat-accumulating EU Habitats Directive priority habitats whose ecological conditions and biodiversity values may be jeopardized by climate change. Aapa mires depend on the surface water flows from the surroundings which makes them sensitive to hydrological alterations and falling water tables caused by land use (ditching for peatland drainage) as well as climate change (Gong et al. 2012, Sallinen et al. 2019). This sensitivity of aapa mires and their biodiversity to increasing temperatures and decreasing water balance and precipitation can be of particular concern as they occur in northern hemisphere, in areas where the largest climatic changes are projected to take place (AMAP 2017, Väliranta et al. 2017. Kolari et al. 2021). In the study by Heikkinen et al. (in review), we assess the climate exposure of these habitats by developing velocity metrics for both the aapa mire complexes (‘aapa mires’) and their wettest flark-dominated parts (‘wet aapa mires’) in Finland. Aapa mire data: Occurrences of aapa mires were identified from the CORINE CLC2018 land cover data which is available in Finland as a 20 x 20 m resolution raster data, by focusing on the CORINE category 4121 (‘Peatbogs’) which includes various open mires occurring in aapa mire and palsa mire zones, as well as in raised bogs zones. We excluded open mires occurring in the raised bogs zone but included CORINE Peatbog occurrences both from the aapa mire and palsa mire zones. This opted for this decision because open mires in aapa and palsa mire zones share several matching ecological features, and because palsa mires may provide suitable habitats for aapa mire species under warming climate. The adjacent peatbog 20-m pixels in the aapa and palsa mire zones were merged and converted into contiguous peatland polygons. From these, polygons smaller than 10 ha in size were excluded because typically they show only limited number of ecological elements central to the representative aapa mires. These selected ≥10 ha peatland polygons formed the first study mire dataset, aapa mire complexes, or ‘aapa mires’ in short (i.e., the whole aapa mire ecosystem containing all embedded mire habitats therein). The second study mire dataset was constrained to include only the wettest parts of aapa mire complexes characterized by flarks, i.e., open water pools, referred here simply as ‘wet aapa mires’. These wet aapa mire occurrences are typically smaller than the whole aapa mire complexes and occur more sparsely in the landscape. Thus, the climatic exposure of wet aapa mires can be expected to be greater than that of aapa mire complexes. This will very likely cause elevated climate change adaptation challenges for habitat specialist species that require open water or permanently wet environments. The spatial data for the wet aapa mires were determined with the help of the topographic database developed by the National Land Survey of Finland (NLS), and the land cover class ‘Swamps classified as difficult, dangerous and impossible to cross’ therein. Climate data: In the first phase, monthly average air temperature data for 1981–2010 were constructed at the 50 x 50 m spatial resolution across Finland, as described in Aalto et al. (2017) and Heikkinen et al. (2020, 2021). This was done by modelling the weather station data from 313 Fennoscandian stations together with variables of geographical location, local topography and water cover. Monthly precipitation data were developed by fitting kriging interpolation method to the data on 343 rain gauges, and the data on geographical location, topography and proximity to the sea. Based on the monthly temperature and precipitation data, six bioclimatic variables describing key ecological winter- and summer-time conditions for aapa mire ecosystems were calculated (cf. Parviainen and Luoto 2007, Ruuhijärvi 1988, Rydin and Jeglum 2006): (1) annual temperature sum above the base temperature of 5 °C (growing degree days, GDD5), (2) mean January temperature, (3) mean July temperature, (4) monthly climatic water balance calculated for May and (5) for July, and (6) annual precipitation sum. The two climatic water balance variables were calculated as the difference between the May - or July - total precipitation sum and the potential evapotranspiration (PET) in the corresponding month following Skov and Svenning (2004). In the second step, the data based on an ensemble of 23 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archives (Taylor et al. 2012) were employed to develop future climate surfaces averaged for the years 2040–2069 and the two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The monthly air temperature and precipitation data in these climate surfaces were interpolated to match the 50 × 50 m grid, then the change predicted by the GCMs was added to the 1981–2010 climate data, and finally, the values for the six bioclimatic variables were recalculated for the 50-m resolution grid across the whole Finland. In the third step, all the developed climate surface datasets were intersected by the spatial datasets of the two differently delimited aapa mire networks, i.e. ‘aapa mires’ and ‘wet aapa mires’. This allowed calculation of the climate change velocity metrics separately for the two types of aapa mires, namely, for both mire datasets by measuring the distance between climatically similar 50-m grid cells in the present and future climates by considering only locations with either (i) aapa mires, or (ii) wet aapa mires. Thus, matrix areas providing unsuitable habitat for aapa mire biodiversity were excluded and for both types of mires the distance from the present-day mire cell was linked to the nearest corresponding mire cell with similar future climatic conditions. The climate data for the years 1981 – 2010 and the future time slice of 2040–2069 and the two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), clipped to the networks of the two types of aapa mires for all the six bioclimatic variables are included in the following two zipped files: ‘climate\_data\_aapa\_mires.zip’ and ‘climate\_data\_wet\_aapa\_mires.zip’. Climate change velocity metrics: The climate velocities for the six bioclimatic variables, developed separately for the two types of aapa mires and the two RCPs, were calculated with climate-analog method (see Brito-Morales et al. 2018). For these calculations, both the present-day and future climate data from the two RCP scenarios were converted from continuous values into categorical climate surfaces following Hamann et al. (2015). During these conversion processes, following categories and within-class ranges were used: GDD5, within-class range 50 °C; January and July temperatures, within-class range 0.5 °C; water balance of May and July, within-class range 2.5 mm; and annual precipitation, within-class range 25 mm. In the conversion process, the climate surfaces in each of the 50-m grid cells were reclassified into one of the 29 GDD5, 27 January temperature, 22 July temperature, 21 May water balance, 22 July water balance, and 19 annual precipitation categories. Using the reclassified climate surfaces, the minimum distances between mire grid cells with similar present-day and future climates for the six variables were determined with the Euclidean distance function in ArcGIS. In the final step of calculating the velocity metrics, the mire-to-mire distances were divided by the number of years between the two points in time (see Brito-Morales et al., 2018; Heikkinen et al., 2020). The derived velocity metrics for the six bioclimatic variables yielded six individual estimates of climate exposure for the two types of study mires, illustrating the magnitude of climate displacement that the local mire species communities are projected to experience (Hamann et al. 2015, Brito-Morales et al., 2018). In our study, for each contiguous aapa mire and wet aapa mire, the mean velocity value for the climate variables were calculated as the average of the 50-m grid cells included in it. The data on the 50-m resolution velocities for the six bioclimatic variables and the two types of aapa mires and the two RCPs are included in the zip file ‘velocity\_data\_for\_mires.zip’.

  abstract = {Climate velocity is an increasingly used metric to detect habitats, locations and regions which are exposed to high rates of climate change and displacement. In general, velocities are measured based on the assumption that future climatically similar locations can occur anywhere in the study landscape. However, this assumption can provide a biased basis for habitats which are constrained to specific environmental conditions. For such habitats, a set of selected suitable locations may provide ecologically more realistic velocity measures. Here, we focus on one environmentally constrained habitat, aapa mires, which are peat-accumulating EU Habitats Directive priority habitats, whose ecological conditions and biodiversity values may be jeopardised by climate change. We assess the climate exposure of aapa mires in Finland by developing velocity metrics separately for the whole ≥10~ha aapa mire complexes (‘aapa mires’) and their wettest flark-dominated parts (‘flark fens’). Velocity metrics were developed for six bioclimatic variables (growing degree days (GDD5), mean January and July temperatures, annual precipitation, and May and July water balance, based on climate data for 1981–2010 and for 2040–2069 as derived from global climate models for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). For the six variables, velocities were calculated based on the distance between climatically similar present-day and nearest future mire, divided by the number of years between the two periods, and by excluding the unsuitable matrix. Both aapa mires and flark fens showed high exposure ({$>$}5~km/year) to changes in January temperature, and often also considerably high velocities for GDD5 and July temperatures. The flark fens showed significantly higher climate velocities than the aapa mires and had a smaller amount of corresponding habitat in their surroundings. Thus, many of the studied mires, particularly the flark fens, are likely to face increased risks of exposure due to changes in winter and summer temperatures. Moreover, considerable changes in precipitation-related conditions may occur at the southern margin of the aapa mire zone. Our results show that specifically tailored climate velocity metrics can provide a useful quantitative tool to inform conservation and management decisions to support the ecosystem sustainability of this EU Habitats Directive biotope and targeting restoration towards the most vulnerable aapa mires.},

  abstract = {Aim Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM) methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca. 324,000 km2. Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular plots of 0.9 km2. Distribution models for each VT were obtained by logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in 100 m × 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest, whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones. Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system models.},

  abstract = {Here we address the combined impact of multiple stressors that are becoming more common with climate change. To study the combined effects of a lower water table (WT) and increased frequency of drought periods on the resistance and resilience of peatlands, we conducted a mesocosm experiment. This study evaluated how the photosynthesis of lawn Sphagnum mosses responds to and recovers from an experimental periodic drought after exposure to the stresses of a deep or deepened WT (naturally dry and 17-year-long water level drawdown [WLD] in fen and bog environments). We aimed to quantify if deep WTs (1) support acclimation to drought, or (2) increase the base-level physiological stress of mosses or (3) exacerbate the impact of periodic drought. There was no evidence of acclimation in mosses from drier environments; periodic drought decreased the photosynthesis of all Sphagnum species studied. WLDdecreased the photosynthesis of bog-originating mosses prior to periodic drought, indicating that these mosses were stressed by the hydrological change. Deep WTs exacerbated Sphagnum vulnerability to periodic drought, indicating that the combination of drying habitats and increasing frequency of periodic drought could lead to a rapid transition in lawn vegetation. Water-retaining traits may increase Sphagnum resilience to periodic drought. Large capitula size was associated with a higher resistance; the bog originating species studied here lacked large capitula or dense carpet structure and were more vulnerable to drought than the larger fen originating species. Consequently, lawns in bogs may become threatened. Recovery after rewetting was significant for all mosses, but none completely recovered within 3 weeks. The most drought-resilient species had fen origin, indicating that fens are less likely to undergo a sudden transition due to periodic drought. Synthesis: Water level drawdown associated with climate change increases the sensitivity of Sphagnum mosses to periods of drought and moves them closer to their tipping point as species on the edge of their ecological envelope rapidly shut down photosynthesis and recover poorly.},

To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive synthesis data analysis from 87 peatland sites (350 observations) spanning boreal, temperate, and tropical zones, and investigated the spatial distribution pattern of Q10 and its correlation with climate conditions, soil properties, and hydrology. Findings revealed distinct Q10 values across climate zones: boreal peatlands exhibited the highest Q10, trailed by temperate and then tropical peatlands. Latitude presented a positive correlation with Q10, while mean annual air temperature and precipitation revealed a negative correlation. The results from the structural equation model suggest that soil properties, such as carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N) and peat type, were the primary drivers of the variance in Q10 of peat respiration. Peat C/N ratios negatively correlated with Q10 of peat respiration and the relationship between C/N and Q10 varied significantly between peat types. Our data analyses also revealed that Q10 was influenced by soil moisture levels, with significantly lower values observed for peat soils under wet than dry conditions. Essentially, boreal and temperate peatlands seem more vulnerable to global warming-induced soil organic carbon decomposition than tropical counterparts, with wet peatlands showing higher climate resilience.},

Therefore, restoring disturbed and degraded peatlands is an emerging priority in efforts to mitigate climate change. While restoration can revive multiple ecosystem functions, including carbon storage, the resilience of restored peatlands to climate change and other disturbances remains poorly understood. Here, we review the recent literature on the response of degraded and restored peatlands to fire, drought and flood. We find that degraded sites can generally be restored in a way that allows for net carbon sequestration. However, biodiversity, hydrological regime, and peat soil structure are not always fully restored, even after a decade of restoration efforts, potentially weakening ecosystem resilience to future disturbances. As the recovery of degraded peatlands is fundamental to achieving net-zero goals and biodiversity targets, sound science and monitoring efforts are needed to further inform restoration investments and priorities.},

  abstract = {seNorge\_2018 is a collection of observational gridded datasets over Norway for daily total precipitation: daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures. The time period covers 1957 to 2017, and the data are presented over a high-resolution terrain-following grid with 1\&thinsp;km spacing in both meridional and zonal directions. The seNorge family of observational gridded datasets developed at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) has a 20-year-long history and seNorge\_2018 is its newest member, the first providing daily minimum and maximum temperatures. seNorge datasets are used for a wide range of applications in climatology, hydrology, and meteorology. The observational dataset is based on MET Norway's climate data, which have been integrated by the “European Climate Assessment and Dataset” database. Two distinct statistical interpolation methods have been developed, one for temperature and the other for precipitation. They are both based on a spatial scale-separation approach where, at first, the analysis (i.e., predictions) at larger spatial scales is estimated. Subsequently they are used to infer the small-scale details down to a spatial scale comparable to the local observation density. Mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures are interpolated separately; then physical consistency among them is enforced. For precipitation, in addition to observational data, the spatial interpolation makes use of information provided by a climate model. The analysis evaluation is based on cross-validation statistics and comparison with a previous seNorge version. The analysis quality is presented as a function of the local station density. We show that the occurrence of large errors in the analyses decays at an exponential rate with the increase in the station density. Temperature analyses over most of the domain are generally not affected by significant biases. However, during wintertime in data-sparse regions the analyzed minimum temperatures do have a bias between 2\&thinsp;∘C and 3\&thinsp;∘C. Minimum temperatures are more challenging to represent and large errors are more frequent than for maximum and mean temperatures. The precipitation analysis quality depends crucially on station density: the frequency of occurrence of large errors for intense precipitation is less than 5\% in data-dense regions, while it is approximately 30\&thinsp;\% in data-sparse regions. The open-access datasets are available for public download at daily total precipitation (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2082320, Lussana, 2018b); and daily mean (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2023997, Lussana, 2018c), maximum (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2559372, Lussana, 2018e), and minimum (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2559354, Lussana, 2018d) temperatures.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models have evolved to combine species-environment interactions across multiple scales. Spatially nested hierarchical models (NSDMs) offer a promising avenue by integrating datasets and predictive models from broad to fine scales. But a user-friendly tool to execute these models remains an important ongoing challenge. To address this gap, we introduce the sabinaNSDM R package that provides a straightforward approach to develop NSDMs. This package merges global scale models, capturing extensive ecological niches, with regional scale models featuring high-resolution covariates, to form a unified hierarchical modelling framework. This toolkit is designed to facilitate the implementation of NSDMs for ecologists, conservationists and researchers aiming to produce more reliable species distribution predictions. sabinaNSDM streamlines the data preparation, calibration, integration and projection of models across two scales. It automates (if necessary) the generation of background points, spatial thinning of species occurrence and absence (if available) data, covariate selection and the generation of NSDMs. This paper outlines the workflow and functions integrated into the sabinaNSDM package, complemented by an applied case study involving a pool of 76 tree species. Consistent with previous publications, the generated NSDMs facilitated precise predictions (mean AUC value through independent evaluation higher than 0.88) of species distributions under current and future environmental scenarios.},

  abstract = {Peatlands play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Sphagnum mosses (peat mosses) are considered to be the peatland ecosystem engineers and contribute to the carbon accumulation in the peatland ecosystems. As cold-adapted species, the dominance of Sphagnum mosses in peatlands will be threatened by climate warming. The response of Sphagnum mosses to climate change is closely related to the future trajectory of carbon fluxes in peatlands. However, the impact of climate change on the habitat suitability of Sphagnum mosses on a global scale is poorly understood. To predict the potential impact of climate change on the global distribution of Sphagnum mosses, we used the MaxEnt model to predict the potential geographic distribution of six Sphagnum species that dominate peatlands in the future (2050 and 2070) under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5). The results show that the mean temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation of the driest month, and topsoil calcium carbonate are the main factors affecting the habitat availability of Sphagnum mosses. As the climate warms, Sphagnum mosses tend to migrate northward. The suitable habitat and abundance of Sphagnum mosses increase extensively in the high-latitude boreal peatland (north of 50°N) and decrease on a large scale beyond the high-latitude boreal peatland. The southern edge of boreal peatlands would experience the greatest decline in the suitable habitat and richness of Sphagnum mosses with the temperature rising and would be a risk area for the transition from carbon sink to carbon source. The spatial–temporal pattern changes of Sphagnum mosses simulated in this study provide a reference for the development of management and conservation strategies for Sphagnum bogs.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing need for ecosystem-level distribution models (EDMs) and a better understanding of which factors affect their quality. We investigated how the performance and transferability of EDMs are influenced by 1) the choice of predictors and 2) model complexity. We modelled the distribution of 15 pre-classified ecosystem types in Norway using 252 predictors gridded to 100 × 100 m resolution. The ecosystem types are major types in the ‘Nature in Norway' system mainly defined by rule-based criteria such as whether soil or specific functional groups (e.g. trees) are present. The predictors were categorised into four groups, of which three represented proxies for natural, anthropogenic, or terrain processes (‘ecological predictors') and one represented spectral and structural characteristics of the surface observable from above (‘surface predictors'). Models were generated for five levels of model complexity. Model performance and transferability were evaluated with data collected independently of the training data. We found that 1) models trained with surface predictors only performed considerably better and were more transferable than models trained with ecological predictors, and 2) model performance increased with model complexity, levelling off from approximately 10 parameters and reaching a peak at approximately 20 parameters, while model transferability decreased with model complexity. Our findings suggest that surface predictors enhance EDM performance and transferability, most likely because they represent discernible surface characteristics of the ecosystem types. A poor match between the rule-based criteria that define the ecosystem types and the ecological predictors, which represent ecological processes, is a plausible explanation for why surface predictors better predict the distribution of ecosystem types. Our results indicate that, in most cases, the same models are not well suited for contrasting purposes, such as predicting where ecosystems are and explaining why they are there.},

Along a transect line crossing two open mires affected by forest succession we analysed tree age distribution. One of those mires had been drained in the past years and still retained some open ditches, while the other one was located far from the ditches. Every 10 meters along the transect line one tree was drilled at the root collar in order to determine its age. We also conducted phytosociological analyses and short-term water level measurements in the sample plots. We expected faster tree encroachment in the undisturbed part of the open mire. The results showed, that there were no significant differences in water table level and in soil moisture indicator values between the formerly drained and undisturbed open mire. There were also no statistically significant differences in tree encroachment between the disturbed and undisturbed mires. Location and the age distribution of the trees suggest that changes in the tree growth conditions cannot be directly explained by the general decreasing of water level in the bog, although periods following drainage works were associated with more numerous establishment of young trees, in the drained part of the bog as well as in the part not directly affected by drainage ditches.},

  abstract = {Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are powerful tools for assessing suitable habitats across large areas and at fine spatial resolution. Yet, the usefulness of SDMs for mapping species' realised distributions is often limited since data biases or missing information on dispersal barriers or biotic interactions hinder them from accurately delineating species' range limits. One way to overcome this limitation is to integrate SDMs with expert range maps, which provide coarse-scale information on the extent of species' ranges and thereby range limits that are complementary to information offered by SDMs. Innovation Here, we propose a new approach for integrating expert range maps in SDMs based on an ensemble method called stacked generalisation. Specifically, our approach relies on training a meta-learner regression model using predictions from one or more SDM algorithms alongside the distance of training points to expert-defined ranges as predictor variables. We demonstrate our approach with an occurrence dataset for 49 bat species covering four biodiversity hotspots in the Eastern Mediterranean, Western Asia and Central Asia. Main Conclusions Our approach offers a flexible method to integrate expert range maps with any combination of SDM modelling algorithms, thus facilitating the use of algorithm ensembles. In addition, it provides a novel, data-driven way to account for uncertainty in expert-defined ranges not requiring prior knowledge about their accuracy, which is often lacking. Integrating expert range maps into SDMs for bats resulted in more realistic predictions of distribution patterns that showed narrower niche breadths and smaller range overlaps between species compared to traditional SDMs. Our approach holds promise to improve assessments of species distributions, while our work highlights the overlooked potential of stacked generalisation as an ensemble method in species distribution modelling.},

  abstract = {By the end of this century, much of the climate space of western Canada's boreal forest is expected to shift northwards and be replaced by climates that are currently associated with aspen forest, parkland and grassland ecosystems. In this study, we review the various processes that will mediate ecological responses to these projected changes in climate. We conclude that ecological transitions are unlikely to involve a gradual wave-like shift in ecotonal boundaries. Instead, we predict that ecological changes will lag substantially behind changes in climate and that individual ecosystem components will respond at different rates. In particular, if precipitation inputs are maintained as expected, then peatlands should exhibit considerable resilience to climate change and remain a dominant feature on the landscape in 2100. Because peatlands retain large amounts of water on the landscape their continued presence may in turn slow the rate of forest loss, especially the aspen component. Thus, ecological response to climate change in the western boreal region may involve a transition to a novel ecosystem that includes peatlands and aspen as dominant features – unlike anything that exists today. Moreover, this interim stage may remain in place well into the next century, potentially providing additional time for forest-dependent species to adapt. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Peatlands store disproportionally large amounts of carbon per unit area, a function that is dependent on maintaining high and stable water tables. Climate change is likely to negatively impact carbon storage in peatlands, in part due to increases in vapour pressure deficit (VPD) driving higher evaporation (E) rates. However, the response of E to increasing VPD depends on the dominant vegetation type within peatlands. In this study, we used multiple years of eddy covariance (EC) measurements to compare E regimes at two peatlands with contrasting vegetation types – Kopuatai bog in Aotearoa / New Zealand, dominated by the vascular wire rush Empodisma robustum, and Mer Bleue bog in Canada, a “typical” shrub- and moss-dominated Northern Hemisphere peatland. We examined seasonal variability in E and equilibrium E (Eeq), energy balance partitioning, and the response of E, evaporative fraction (EF), and canopy conductance (gc) to VPD. Mean annual E was 45 \% lower than mean annual Eeq at Kopuatai but only 16 \% lower at Mer Bleue, demonstrating much greater limitations on E at Kopuatai. In addition, the mean midday (10:00–14:30 local standard time) dry-canopy Bowen ratio (β) at Kopuatai was 2.0 compared to 0.8 at Mer Bleue; therefore, the sensible heat flux (H) dominated over the latent heat flux (LE) at Kopuatai and vice versa at Mer Bleue. The responses of E, EF, and gc to increasing VPD at Kopuatai demonstrated stronger limitations on evaporative water loss for VPD \&gt; 0.7 kPa compared to Mer Bleue. The observed limitations at Kopuatai were attributed to strong stomatal control by E. robustum due to the rapid decrease in gc with increasing VPD; however, surface E could also be limited by its dense standing litter. At Mer Bleue, however, E was only weakly limited at VPD \&gt; 2 kPa, likely due to weak stomatal control over transpiration by the sparse shrub canopy and relatively large surface E from Sphagnum carpets. As such, the results of this study suggest that E. robustum drives a greater “hydrological resistance” to increasing VPD than the vegetation at Mer Bleue, leading to greater water retention at Kopuatai. This may enable greater resilience of the carbon sink function at Kopuatai to climatic warming and drying than at Mer Bleue.},

Vegetation composition and structure are recognised indicators for carbon sequestration and storage potential in these ecosystems, but decadal dynamics and roles of autogenic succession, climate, and land-use herein remain poorly understood. We assessed vegetation changes in the least disturbed centre of twelve Irish peatland reserves sampled across a gradient in temperature and precipitation between 1978(1983)–2021, combining re-classified traditional high-resolution vegetation maps with recent very high-resolution drone imagery. Specifically, we tested whether microform proportions of open water, wet hollow, moist lawn, and dry hummock had changed and explored to what extent changes were related to climate and land-use drivers. Results revealed that the studied peatlands underwent an overall unidirectional surface drying trend, with dry hummocks expanding at the expense of open water and wet hollow, while moist lawns remained approximately equal in proportions. The degree of change varied between the studied peatlands, with western blanket bogs and unrestored raised bogs experiencing more surface drying than mountain blanket bogs and raised bogs under hydrological restoration. While our results indicated climate and/or land-use as drivers of surface drying, our sample size was too small to make definitive conclusions about their exact role. The overall change from wet to dry surface conditions between 1978 and 2021 occurred at a much faster rate than hitherto reported for these slow-changing ecosystems. This raises concern for the future resilience of peatlands to changes in climate and land-use, as well as their potential impact on the peatland carbon balance.},

  abstract = {Geographic distributions are a basic component of a species’ ecology, and predicting distributions is a fundamental task of conservation and resource management. Reliable prediction depends on identification of appropriate scales of effect for environmental data, and scale-optimization techniques are thus desirable to identify optimal scales for predictor variables. Recent statistical developments have also advanced methods of model selection based explicitly on predictive ability, which differ from commonly used methods that regulate model structures via anticipated predictive performance. Such methods are beginning to permeate into species distribution models (SDMs), yet there remains no consensus methodology for developing optimally predictive multi-scale SDMs when covariate data are collected over a range of scales. Thus, we compared the performance of common approaches for scale optimization and model selection in terms of their ability to produce optimally predictive multi-scale Bayesian occupancy models for predicting a species distribution, using models of the breeding distribution for King Rails (Rallus elegans) as a case study. Our results demonstrate sizable gains in predictive performance for hierarchical occupancy models selected via their ability to predict out-of-sample data using the logarithmic scoring rule, as compared to models selected using information criteria (deviance information criteria [DIC] and Watanabe information criteria [WAIC]). Information criteria commonly selected individual covariates, as well as scales of effect for those covariates, with suboptimal predictive performance. Performance of models selected using the logarithmic scoring rule was also robust across the method of scale optimization, which was not true for models selected using DIC and WAIC. Thus, we demonstrate empirical benefits of study designs and statistical tools that enable covariate and scale selection based explicitly on predictive ability. Our results also imply that more careful consideration of what constitutes an optimal scale is warranted in many ecological applications, as the meaning of optimal is not independent of the technique used for scale selection.},

  abstract = {In spite of the worldwide largest proportional loss of mires, Europe is a continent with important mire diversity. This article analyses the condition and protection status of European mire ecosystems. The overview is based on the system of European mire regions, representing regional variety and ecosystem biodiversity. We combined peatland distribution data with land cover maps of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service as well as with the World Database on Protected Areas to assess the extent of degraded peatlands and the proportion of peatlands located in protected areas in each European mire region. The total proportion of degraded peatlands in Europe is 25\%; within the EU it is 50\% (120,000 km2). The proportion of degradation clearly increases from north to south, as does the proportion of peatlands located within protected areas. In more than half of Europe’s mire regions, the target of at least 17\% of the area located in protected areas is not met with respect to peatlands. Data quality is discussed and the lessons learned from Europe for peatland conservation are presented.},

  abstract = {The spatial variation in monthly temperature normals (1961-90) from southern Norway was studied. Linear regression as well as an approach combining a deterministic and a geostatistical model were applied (residual kriging). The deterministic component describes the large-scale trend in the temperature, and in this study is defined as the vertical temperature gradient. The spatial variability caused by differences in elevation is removed by reducing the temperatures to sea level. The resulting temperature fields are more suited for spatial statistical analysis. These temperatures are closer to fulfilling the assumptions most statistical interpolation methods require, i.e. stationarity and isotropy. The reduced temperatures were interpolated applying kriging. It is shown that residual kriging gives better estimates than kriging on station level temperatures. Residual kriging is also more credible than the linear regression approach, which regionally gives large estimation errors.},

  abstract = {Large-scale changes in climate may have unexpected effects on ecosystems, given the importance of climate as a control over almost all ecosystem attributes and internal feedbacks. Changes in plant community productivity or composition, for example, may alter ecosystem resource dynamics, trophic structures, or disturbance regimes, with subsequent positive or negative feedbacks on the plant community. At northern latitudes, where increases in temperature are expected to be greatest but where plant species diversity is relatively low, climatically mediated changes in species composition or abundance will likely have large ecosystem effects. In this study, we investigated effects of infrared loading and manipulations of water-table elevation on net primary productivity of plant species in bog and fen wetland mesocosms between 1994 and 1997. We removed 27 intact soil monoliths (2.1 m2 surface area, 0.5–0.7 m depth) each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water-table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Overhead infrared lamps caused mean monthly soil temperatures to increase by 1.6–4.1°C at 15-cm depth during the growing season (May–October). In 1996, depths to water table averaged −11, −19, and −26 cm in the bog plots, and 0, −10, and −19 cm in the fen plots. Annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of bryophyte, forb, graminoid, and shrub life-forms was determined for the dominant species in the mesocosm plots based on species-specific canopy/biomass relationships. Belowground net primary production (BNPP) was estimated using root in-growth cores. Bog and fen communities differed in their response to infrared loading and water-table treatments because of the differential response of life-forms and species characteristic of each community. Along a gradient of increasing water-table elevation, production of bryophytes increased, and production of shrubs decreased in the bog community. Along a similar gradient in the fen community, production of graminoids and forbs increased. Along a gradient of increasing infrared loading in the bog, shrub production increased whereas graminoid production decreased. In the fen, graminoids were most productive at high infrared loading, and forbs were most productive at medium infrared loading. In the bog and fen, BNPP:ANPP ratios increased with warming and drying, indicating shifts in carbon allocation in response to climate change. Further, opposing responses of species and life-forms tended to cancel out the response of production at higher levels of organization, especially in the bog. For example, total net primary productivity in the bog did not differ between water-table treatments because BNPP was greatest in the dry treatment whereas ANPP was greatest in the wet treatment. The differential responses of species, life-forms, and above- and belowground biomass production to the treatments suggest that bog and fen plant communities will change, in different directions and magnitudes, in response to warming and changes in water-table elevation. Further, results of this and complementary research indicate that these peatlands may mediate their energy, carbon, and nutrient budgets through differential responses of the plant communities. Thus, predictions of the response of peatlands to changes in climate should consider differences in plant community structure, as well as biogeochemistry and hydrology, that characterize and differentiate these two ecosystems.},
